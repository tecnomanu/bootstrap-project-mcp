# Global Code Standards

-   Follow consistent code formatting across the entire project.
-   Use meaningful variable and function names that explain their purpose.
-   Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
-   Add meaningful comments for complex logic, but avoid obvious comments.
-   Remove debug code, commented-out code and console logs before committing.
-   Use proper indentation (spaces or tabs) consistently throughout the project.
-   Follow the language/framework's standard style guide.
-   Avoid deep nesting of conditionals and loops.
